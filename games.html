              <p>Chronos Science Corporation has multiple games, including a line of a game.</p>
              <h2>Military Facility Tycoon Line</h2>
              <h3>MFT 1</h3>
              <img src="/source//imgs/mft1.png" alt="Cover image of Military Facility Tycoon 1" style="float: right" width="500px" length="500px"> 
              <img src="/source/imgs/mft2.png" alt="Cover image of Military Faciltiy Tycoon 2" style="float: right; padding-right: 50px" width="500ox" length="500px">
              <p>Military Facility Tycoon 1 was the start of the MFT Game line, proving to be great for its time, but sadly production in that game has come to an end. The game is still available to play but it is no match for the new game MFT 2.</p>

              <h3>MFT 2</h3>
              <p>Military Facility Tycoon 2 is the second game in the MFT Game line, but it proves to be the better of the two. This game is still actively being developed by the Clandestine themself, hopefully releasing an update soon!</p>

              <p>Temporal Research Facility (Or TRF) is a game where you have to escape a facility, hence it had the name ESCAPE.</p>
              <br>
              <p>There are multiple teams to choose from, like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Inmate</li>
                <li>Security</li>
                <li>Defector</li>
                <li>and Various Site Teams!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The goal of the inmate team is to escape the facility before you are dragged into research by a researcher, or before you are killed by the ever-watching security.</p>
              <p>Security's goal is to save the facility from the defectors, likewise defectors have to explode everything and kill the security before security kills them.</p>
              <p>Site teams like employee get to manage the reactor before it becomes a hostage situation.</p>
              <br>
              <p>TRF is still actively receiving updates, including a new update which will release soon!</p>
