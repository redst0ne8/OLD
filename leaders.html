                  My name actually came from a D&D campaign. The whole character was an Owlin that had coffee colors, but I wanted to have a unique name. I decided to make a play on the Heighleigh spelling, and applied it to mine!

                  Hi! I'm Cyte, the Community Director here at CSC, where I lead the Community Moderation side of CSC, alongside my Community Coordinator and Division Coordinator.
                  <br>
                  They do alot of work behind the scenes, so please thank them for it!!
                  <br>
                  I joined CSC in December 2023, through Discord Admins, from there, I completed my trainee phase, became LCM and eventually CC, kept going and now reached CD! :sunglasses:
                  <br>
                  My first username used to be "Shadowcyte" as I wanted to look for an Xbox name üòÖ
                  <br>
                  I ended up shortening it to Cyte, which I stick with now
                  <br>
                  I'm always open for a chat or VC, if you see me online, you can always send me a DM! üì´
                  <br>
                  For now though, Take care and I hope you have a great day! üëã
