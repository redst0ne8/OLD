            <p>Chronos Science Corporation is decently big, thus making it no easy task to manage it. The Executives have hired some addition people to help run CSC, and here you can get to know about them!

                  <p>I'm happy to see how successful the games have been and how much the server has grown recently. It’s been especially helpful to identify bugs, implement new suggestions, and connect with people passionate about the games. When this project started several years ago, I never thought it would take off like it did.</p>

                <h3>What is your favorite animal and why?</h3>
                  <p>🐱I'd like a cat because they seem more relatable to me. I think they'd match my energy. However, I'm quite fond of this spinning seal. Seal be chillin'.</p>

                    Most of my passion is for CSC. Before CSC, I was so bored that I got a weekend job, while already having a job during the week! Other than CSC, I guess I really enjoy listening to music, watching movies🎥, and bowling🎳. I used to work at a theatre and bowling alley, and they still let me do stuff for free! I like to get them donuts occasionally, to let them know I appreciate their generosity.

                  My online life started in 2015, when I got my first laptop. All I wanted to play was Minecraft because I saw 💎DanTDM's block hunt videos and thought that was cool. I joined a server called Noble Craft and was obsessed with survival plots. I eventually made a gigantic pumpkin farm, so I could sell at the market💰. Then, in 2016, 💎DanTDM played an easter egg tycoon game in roblox, so I've been playing Roblox ever since. Interesting how I built giant money farms in minecraft, and I still enjoy doing the same in tycoons!
                  <br>
                  As for real life, not much going on. I'm currently building a career in IT, and I'm thinking of pursuing information security, networking, or both!

                  Hi! I'm Cyte, the Community Director here at CSC, where I lead the Community Moderation side of CSC, alongside my Community Coordinator and Division Coordinator.
                  <br>
                  They do alot of work behind the scenes, so please thank them for it!!
                  <br>
                  I joined CSC in December 2023, through Discord Admins, from there, I completed my trainee phase, became LCM and eventually CC, kept going and now reached CD! :sunglasses:
                  <br>
                  My first username used to be "Shadowcyte" as I wanted to look for an Xbox name 😅
                  <br>
                  I ended up shortening it to Cyte, which I stick with now
                  <br>
                  I'm always open for a chat or VC, if you see me online, you can always send me a DM! 📫
                  <br>
                  For now though, Take care and I hope you have a great day! 👋
